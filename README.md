# titanic_dataset_prediction
i've entered the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle,

instead of dropping the Age column or filling missing values with median Age
i decided to train a RandomForestRegressor model that predicts missing values .

i then trained and fine-tuned RandomForestClassifier to predict Survivors 
and scored  77.75/100.

i got placed 3692 of 13236 on the leaderboard.
